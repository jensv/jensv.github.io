My motivation for research stems from the stimulating conversations I have with peers. I am often amazed by the ideas that spring forth in our team discussions on theory, instrument designs, and data analysis techniques. These conversations can be mentally taxing, but the gratification from answering a question by connecting it back to basic scientific principles is enormous. My background is in plasma physics, an area of research which spans a wide range of basic scientific and applied fields from astrophysics to fusion energy. I recognize the impact that scientists can have in sharing their work and their excitement for their research and educate a broader general audience. Therefore, along with my career goal of research, I am committed to be involved with ongoing educational and outreach activities.
